Pandas puts pretty much every common data munging tool at your fingertips. This means that basic cleanup and some advanced manipulation can be performed with Pandas’ powerful dataframes."

NumPy’s functions are exposed in Pandas for advanced numeric analysis." , "If you need something more specialized, chances are it’s out there", "SciPy is the scientific equivalent of NumPy, offering tools and techniques for analysis of scientific data.
